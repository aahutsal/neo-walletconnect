*** The problem
    Project require Rrivate NEO Network for development and testing, since Private NEO Network itself consist of bunch of components it's hard and time-consuming to set them all up and running
#+begin_src plantuml :file docs/NEOPB_implementation.png :exports results
together {
         cloud "NEO Private Network" as NEOPB {
           [NEO Node1] as NEO1
           [NEO Node2] as NEO2
           [NEO Node3] as NEO3
           [NEO Node3] as NEO4
           [PostgreSQL Server] as PGSQL
           NEO1 --> PGSQL: Connects to
           NEO2 --> PGSQL: Connects to
           NEO3 --> PGSQL: Connects to
           NEO4 --> PGSQL: Connects to
         }
}

*** Solution
    All the components needed are wrapped with Docker images and run via `docker-compose`

*** How to run
```
    cd neo-walletconect
    docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f neo-scan-docker/docker-compose.yml
```
