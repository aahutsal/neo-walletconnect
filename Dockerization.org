*** The problem
    Project require Private NEO Network for development and testing, since Private NEO Network itself consists of bunch of components it's hard and time-consuming to set them all up and running
#+begin_src plantuml :file docs/NEOPB_implementation.png :exports results
together {
   package "NEO Scan" as NEOSCAN {
         [NEO Scan Webapp] as NEOSCANWEB

         cloud "NEO Private Network" as NEOPB {
           [NEO Node1] as NEO1
           [NEO Node2] as NEO2
           [NEO Node3] as NEO3
           [NEO Node3] as NEO4
           [PostgreSQL Server] as PGSQL
           NEO1 --> PGSQL: Connects to
           NEO2 --> PGSQL: Connects to
           NEO3 --> PGSQL: Connects to
           NEO4 --> PGSQL: Connects to
         }
         NEOSCANWEB --> NEOPB
  }

  [NEO Walletconnect Bridge] as NEOWalletconnect
  NEOWalletconnect --> NEOPB: Connects to [NEO1..NEO4] via Round-Robin or Random algos
}

*** Solution
    All the components needed are wrapped with Docker images and run via `docker-compose`

*** How to run
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
    cd neo-walletconnect
    docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f neo-scan-docker/docker-compose.yml up
#+END_SRC
